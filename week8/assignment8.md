### Assignment 8 Pygame Animation with Class/Object

- Load and commit your own favorite image for this assignment
- Define a class for your image that allows itself to be animated ( The main goal this week is just to make it move. If you want it to do sth else, go for it!)
- Create multiple instances of the same class and make each individual instance unique! (different image/color, different speed of moving etc...)
- Add some random variables in the initiation process, so every time you run the program, the result looks a bit different (random initial positions/speeds, patterns...)

Bonus:
- Make your images move in non-linear way (e.g.: rotating in a circle)
- Add special effects to the images or other items based on your own research on pygame
